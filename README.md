* Can I use it for making my personal/commercial portfolio? 
-> Definitely. But make sure you FORK it while doing it :)

* Can I share your portfolio link with my friends?
-> DEFINITELY! ^_^

* Can I contact you if I get stuck while trying to create my own portfolio using the forked source code?
-> DEFINITELY! :)
